ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

# Long-Term Warming Observed

- The 10-year MAVG shows a steady upward trend, especially post 1995.
- The baseline temperature has gradually increased, highlighting long-term climate change effects in Bengaluru.

# Extreme Heat Years Identified

- 1998 recorded an average temperature of 25.40Â°C
- 2003 hit 25.73Â°C, the highest in the dataset

# Rising Volatility in Recent Decades

- Post-2000, the annual average temperature line fluctuates more intensely
- This indicates increased climate instability.
- This is in contrast to the more stable trend during the 1950sâ€“1980s

# 2023 Temperature Dip

- Despite long-term warming, 2023 saw a notable drop in average temperature
- falling below the 10-year MAVG curve
- This could reflect short-term natural variation or regional climatic anomalies

# Urban Heat Signature Evident

- Comparing early decades to recent years, Bengaluruâ€™s average annual temperature has risen by ~0.5Â°C, consistent with urbanization effects and reduced green cover.

# Visual Smoothing Validated Trends
- The 10-year MAVG effectively smooths fluctuations and reveals the underlying warming pattern, which may be obscured in year-to-year values alone.
